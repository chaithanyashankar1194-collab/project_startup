Introduction to Calculus
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation. It has two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.

Key Concepts:
1. Limits and Continuity
   - The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus
   - A function is continuous if it has no breaks or jumps
   - The limit of a function as x approaches a value

2. Derivatives
   - The derivative represents the rate of change
   - Rules for finding derivatives (power rule, product rule, chain rule)
   - Applications in optimization and curve sketching

3. Integrals
   - The integral represents accumulation
   - Definite and indefinite integrals
   - Fundamental theorem of calculus

4. Applications
   - Optimization problems
   - Related rates
   - Area and volume calculations

This document covers essential calculus concepts that are fundamental to understanding advanced mathematics and its applications in science and engineering.`
